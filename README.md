# Double Pendulum Neural ODE Solver

This project attempts to model the motion (angles and angular velocities) of a double pendulum using a neural ODE. To evaluate the performance of the neural ODE, it was trained and tested on a dataset gathered from _, and compared with the result of using established theoretical differential equations for double pendulum motion.

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks (for easier code readability and usability) and several .pth files where neural network weights are stored. 
The notebook titled "Double_Pendulum_Neural_ODE" uses a neural ODE to attempt to model the motion of a double pendulum, and the model weights from the .pth files are saved from and used there.
The notebook titled _ uses the theoretical system of differential equations to do the same.

To clone this repository, use the following terminal command:
```git clone https://github.com/marzg7/doublependulum```

The following are descriptions of the Jupyter notebook files.
